# PomoFit

PomoFit is being built to be a Pomodoro Timer, and on each break you can select a workout to perform, enter the reps, and save that information.

The first iteration of PomoFit will just have simple functionality:
 - The Pomodoro Timer itself
 - The ability to select 3 workouts: Push Ups, Sit Ups, and Squats
 - The ability to enter the number of reps you did for that workout

The motivation for this application was to help with my own health. Since quarantine, I have been sitting a lot while working and it was having an effect on my health. I started using a Pomodoro timer to just get up and walk around every 25 minutes, but I decided to up the ante and work out on my breaks.
